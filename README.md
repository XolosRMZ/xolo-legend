# XOLOLEGEND Marketplace MVP

Production-ready MVP for the XOLOLEGEND NFT + RMZ token marketplace built with Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Project Notes

- Listings live in `src/data/listings.json` and are rendered client-side with filters, sorting, and favorites.
- Collections metadata lives in `src/data/collections.json`.
- TXID confirmations and favorites persist in localStorage.
- Images are local SVG placeholders under `public/placeholders`.

## Deployment

Any Node 18+ environment that supports Next.js 14 works (Vercel, Render, self-host). Build with `npm run build` and serve with `npm run start`.
